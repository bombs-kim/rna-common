# Rules

* The top priority in development is to minimize code growth. To make life easier for future developers, keep code concise and eliminate unnecessary logic.
* Answer in English
* When you leave comments, use English
* Change only explicitly requested things. If you see more things that need to change accordingly, always ask first
* If I ask a question, don’t start coding right away — just answer the question.
  * In particular, if I start with "discuss", do not code.
