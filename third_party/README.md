# Third Party

## Why We Provide License Notices

We provide license notices to ensure that our use of third-party software is lawful and compliant, and to avoid being treated as unauthorized use.  
This is primarily for due diligence and audit purposes. Failure to properly disclose licenses may result in negative findings during investor due diligence or government audits, potentially leading to remediation requirements or contractual disadvantages.

Apache License 2.0 explicitly requires preservation of license and attribution notices when redistributing the work

## Why Original Authors Require This Notice

The rationale is subtle but important. Apache License 2.0 includes a patent license with a termination clause.  
If a user initiates patent litigation alleging that the licensed work itself infringes a patent, the patent license granted under Apache 2.0 terminates immediately. This discourages patent-based attacks against the work by parties who are already benefiting from its use, as doing so would require them to forfeit their usage rights.

Apache License 2.0 states:

> “If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.”  
> — Apache License 2.0, Section 3

In effect, this acts as a legal hack. Even if the original authors have unknowingly implemented something that overlaps with downstream patent claims, the license structure makes it strategically unattractive for users to assert those patents. Initiating a patent attack would require the user to give up their own right to use the software, effectively neutralizing many patent threats by design.


## Impact on Us

Providing this notice does not impose any disadvantage on us:
- No obligation to open-source our code
- No restriction on commercial use
- No limitation on business models, including proprietary and SaaS offerings

License disclosure is therefore a compliance and risk-management measure, not a constraint on our commercial activities.
