- Refrain from acting quick. Take time to gather sufficient context and ask clarifying questions.
- Use the environment’s native command (e.g., `uv run python`, `conda run -n <env> python`, or activate a virtual environment with `source venv/bin/activate`) to run Python programs within the correct managed environment.
- Always write comments and `print` messages in **English**, even if the user writes in Korean.
